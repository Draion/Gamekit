The goal of gamekit is to create a basic game engine that allows fast prototyping build around open source software free for commercial use.

    Using Ogre or Irrlicht for graphics, Bullet for physics, OpenAL for sound
    OgreKit is most actively developed and in svn/trunk, the suspended Irrlicht version is in svn/branches/IrrKit.
    Engine is written in C++ and the game logic can be done in C++, Lua scripting or logic bricks
    Reads all data from Blender .blend files, with future FBX import planned
    Free from viral licenses: only using components using MIT/BSD/Zlib style licenses
    CMake cross-platform build system support that works out-of-the-box, see http://cmake.org
    Gamekit supports Windows and Mac OSX, Linux and iPhone.
